# Day 10 - Blackjack Game with Python

Developed a simple Blackjack game in Python that lets users play against the computer. The game uses random card dealing, score calculation, and comparisons to determine the winner, practicing function design, conditionals, and list manipulation.

## Key Areas Explored

- **Random Card Dealing**: Utilized random card selection to mimic drawing cards in a real Blackjack game.
- **Score Calculation with Lists**: Implemented a function to calculate scores based on current cards and adjust the value of the Ace card (11 or 1) as needed.
- **Game Logic and Comparison**: Created logic to compare scores and determine the winner based on Blackjack rules.
- **Looping and Input Handling**: Used loops to allow continuous card dealing, user input, and game replays.

## Program Highlights

- **Blackjack ASCII Art**: Sets the scene with Blackjack-themed ASCII art.
- **Dynamic Card Dealing**: Allows players to draw cards until they pass or reach a score limit.
- **Score Adjustment for Aces**: Adjusts the value of Aces from 11 to 1 if the player’s score exceeds 21.
- **Score Comparison and Result Output**: Compares final scores and announces the result—Win, Lose, or Draw.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding and implementing basic Blackjack rules in Python.
- Using lists to manage a dynamic hand of cards for each player.
- Practicing loops and conditional statements for gameplay logic.
- Enhancing user experience through text-based input and output.

## Usage

Run the program and follow the prompts:

1. **Start the Game**: Type `'y'` to begin a new Blackjack game.
2. **Draw or Pass**: Decide whether to draw another card or pass based on your current score.
3. **See Results**: Once both the player and computer have completed their turns, the game announces the result.
4. **Replay**: Choose whether to start a new game or end the session.

Enjoy the game of Blackjack!
