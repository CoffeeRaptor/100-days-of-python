# Day 9 - Building a Calculator with Function Mapping

Developed an interactive calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project allows users to continuously calculate with the current result or start a new calculation, providing practice with function mapping and user input handling.

## Key Areas Explored:

- **Using Functions with Inputs for Dynamic Operations**: Mapped arithmetic functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) to symbols for easy access and flexibility.
- **Looping for User Interaction**: Built a loop that allows for continuous calculations based on user choice, either continuing with the current result or starting fresh.
- **Building a Calculator Program**: Created a user-friendly calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with clear instructions for each step.

## Program Highlights:

- **Function Mapping**: Used a dictionary to map symbols to functions, making the program modular and easy to expand.
- **Interactive Design**: Prompts the user after each calculation to either continue with the current result or reset for a new calculation.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures valid inputs for operations and numbers, making it user-friendly and robust.

### Example Usage:

1. **Run the program**: Enter the first number as prompted.
2. **Choose an operation**: Select from the displayed options (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. **Enter the second number**: The program calculates and displays the result.
4. **Choose to continue**: Type `'Y'` to continue with the result or `'N'` to start a new calculation.

This project demonstrates foundational skills in Python, including functions, loops, and dictionary-based function mapping, for a simple but flexible calculator program.
