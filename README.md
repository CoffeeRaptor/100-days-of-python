# 100 Days of Python: A Journey Through Code (Based on Angela Yu's 100 days of Python course)


## Why Iâ€™m Doing This

- **Skill Refresh**: Python is a versatile language, and I want to brush up on fundamentals and advanced topics alike.

## Repository Structure

Each day has its own folder, containing:

- **Code and Scripts**: Solutions, exercises, and mini-projects from the day.
- **README (if needed)**: Notes or highlights for any concepts I found interesting or tricky.
