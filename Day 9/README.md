# Day 9 - Auction Bidding System

An interactive bidding program that simulates an auction. Users can enter their names and bids, and the program 
identifies the highest bidder at the end. This project practices error handling, input validation, 
and data management using Python dictionaries.

## Key Areas Explored

- **Data Storage with Dictionaries**: Storing each bidderâ€™s name and bid amount for easy access and comparison.
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring valid integer entries for bids and prompting users until correct data is provided.
- **Looping Constructs**: Using nested loops to gather multiple bids and confirm if other users want to participate.
- **Flow Control**: Structuring the program to repeat prompts as needed, and to end once all bids are collected.

## Program Highlights

- **Auction ASCII Art**: Displays a fun auction-themed ASCII art to set the mood.
- **Dynamic Bidding Process**: Continuously asks for bids, storing each entry in a dictionary.
- **Highest Bidder Calculation**: After all bids are submitted, the program identifies and announces the highest bidder.

## Learning Outcomes

- Using dictionaries for dynamic data storage and retrieval.
- Implementing error handling for user input to create a smooth user experience.
- Structuring loops and conditional statements to guide program flow effectively.

## Usage

Run the program and follow the prompts:
1. Enter your name and bid amount.
2. Confirm if there are other bidders.
3. Once all bids are submitted, the program will announce the highest bidder.

Happy bidding!
