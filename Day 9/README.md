# Day 9 - Auction Bidding System

Developed an interactive bidding program that simulates an auction environment. Users can enter their names and bids, with the program identifying the highest bidder at the end. This project practices data handling with dictionaries, input validation, and loop control for a smooth user experience.

## Key Areas Explored:

- **Data Storage with Dictionaries**: Storing each bidderâ€™s name and bid for easy access and comparison.
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring valid integer entries for bids and handling errors gracefully.
- **Looping Constructs for User Interaction**: Using nested loops to gather bids and confirm if additional users want to participate.
- **Flow Control**: Structuring the program to continue or end once all bids are collected, based on user input.

## Program Highlights:

- **Auction ASCII Art**: Sets the mood with auction-themed visuals.
- **Dynamic Bidding Process**: Prompts users to enter bids, storing each one in a dictionary.
- **Highest Bidder Calculation**: Identifies and announces the highest bidder after all bids are submitted.
